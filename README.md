# Readium Go Toolkit

More documentation coming soon! Things are changing too quickly right now.

For development, run `go run cmd/server/main.go` to start the server, which by default listens on `127.0.0.1:5080`. Check out the [example configuration file](https://github.com/readium/go-toolkit/blob/master/cmd/server/configs/config.local.toml.example) for configuration options.

## Command line utility

The `rwp` command provides utilities to parse and generate Web Publications.

To install `rwp` in `~/go/bin`, run `make install`. Use `make build` to build the binary in the current directory.
